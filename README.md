How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    -Understanding the intricacies of OpenGL has improved my ability to work with graphics APIs and libraries.
    
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    -I started by understanding the requirements, made a plan, then I broke down how I was going to impliment the plan into smaller tasks, then i implented each task, then tested that what i did worked.
    
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    -I apply this tactic whenever I write code, however I could apply this thinking to anything I do to make bigger projects easier.
    
How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    -While what i did isn't new, when it came to working with my 3D scene i found myself doing alot more testing than I had with past projects. I had to run a test anytime i needed to move and object or applying a texture. I also found myself getting more accustomed to code and files that I hadn't written myself.
    
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    -The entire class worked with iteration, starting with creating the shapes, adding textures, then applying shaders.

  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    -At first this class seemed very daunting but by working through each milestone, I understood each concept easier and made completing the project doable.
    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    -This class gave me a familiarity and confortability with exploring and understanding code that I didn't write myself and I imagine that I will have do do more with this skill in future classes it will be a huge boon to my educational pathway
    
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    -This class gave me a familiarity and confortability with exploring and understanding code that I didn't write myself and as when I     become an actual software developer that will be a skill that is base line it is good to have polished the skill throughout this course.
